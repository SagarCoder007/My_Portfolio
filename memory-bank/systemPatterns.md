# System Patterns: Portfolio Website Architecture

## System Architecture

### Component-Based Structure
```
Portfolio Website
├── Layout Components
│   ├── Navigation (sticky navbar)
│   ├── Hero Section (Three.js background)
│   ├── Content Sections (about, skills, projects, contact)
│   └── Footer
├── Animation System
│   ├── GSAP Timeline Manager
│   ├── Scroll Trigger Controller
│   └── Interaction Handlers
└── 3D Background System
    ├── Three.js Scene Manager
    ├── Particle System
    └── Performance Monitor
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### Animation Strategy
- **GSAP as Primary Engine**: Chosen for performance and cross-browser compatibility
- **ScrollTrigger Integration**: Scroll-based animations for progressive content reveal
- **Timeline Management**: Coordinated animations using GSAP timelines
- **Performance Toggles**: User can disable animations for better performance

### 3D Background Implementation
- **Three.js WebGL Renderer**: Hardware-accelerated 3D graphics
- **Particle Systems**: Floating particles, starfield, or geometric shapes
- **Lightweight Geometry**: Simple shapes to maintain 60fps performance
- **Responsive Scaling**: Fewer particles on mobile devices

### Responsive Design Pattern
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px breakpoints
- **Flexible Grid System**: CSS Grid with fallback to Flexbox
- **Touch-Friendly Interactions**: Larger touch targets on mobile

## Design Patterns in Use

### Module Pattern (JavaScript)
```javascript
const PortfolioApp = {
  navigation: NavigationModule,
  animations: AnimationModule,
  background: ThreeJSModule,
  forms: FormModule
};
```

### Observer Pattern (Scroll Events)
- ScrollTrigger acts as observer for scroll events
- Components register for scroll-based updates
- Centralized scroll event management

### Factory Pattern (Three.js Objects)
- Particle factory for creating different particle types
- Geometry factory for various 3D shapes
- Material factory for consistent styling

### Strategy Pattern (Animation Timing)
- Different animation strategies for different sections
- Configurable timing functions
- Performance-based strategy switching

## Component Relationships

### Navigation System
```
Navbar Component
├── Logo/Brand
├── Menu Items (desktop)
├── Hamburger Button (mobile)
└── Mobile Drawer
    └── Animated Menu Items
```

### Content Sections Flow
```
Hero Section
    ↓ (smooth scroll)
About Section
    ↓ (GSAP fade-in)
Skills Section
    ↓ (progress animations)
Projects Section
    ↓ (card hover effects)
Contact Section
    ↓ (form validation)
Footer
```

### Animation Coordination
```
Page Load
    ↓
Initialize Three.js Background
    ↓
Setup GSAP ScrollTriggers
    ↓
Register Event Listeners
    ↓
Ready for User Interaction
```

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Performance-Critical Paths
1. **Initial Load**: HTML → CSS → JavaScript → GSAP → Three.js
2. **Scroll Performance**: ScrollTrigger → Animation Updates → Render
3. **Interaction Response**: User Input → Animation Trigger → Visual Feedback

### Error Handling Paths
1. **WebGL Not Supported**: Fallback to CSS animations
2. **JavaScript Disabled**: Static layout with basic CSS
3. **Slow Network**: Progressive loading with placeholders

### Mobile Optimization Paths
1. **Touch Events**: Enhanced touch handling for mobile interactions
2. **Reduced Animations**: Simplified animations on smaller screens
3. **Performance Scaling**: Fewer particles and simpler effects

## State Management

### Animation States
- **Loading**: Initial page load animations
- **Idle**: Background animations running
- **Scrolling**: Scroll-triggered animations
- **Interacting**: Hover and click animations
- **Reduced**: Simplified animations for performance

### Navigation States
- **Desktop**: Horizontal navigation bar
- **Mobile Collapsed**: Hamburger menu closed
- **Mobile Expanded**: Hamburger menu open
- **Scrolled**: Modified appearance when scrolled

### Form States
- **Empty**: Initial form state
- **Filling**: User actively inputting data
- **Validating**: Real-time validation feedback
- **Submitting**: Loading state during submission
- **Success/Error**: Final submission states

## Performance Optimization Patterns

### Lazy Loading Strategy
- Images load as they come into viewport
- Three.js initializes after critical content loads
- Non-critical animations defer until page is interactive

### Memory Management
- Three.js objects properly disposed when not needed
- Event listeners cleaned up appropriately
- Animation timelines killed when components unmount

### Rendering Optimization
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Three.js renderer paused when not visible
- CSS transforms used for better performance than changing layout properties
