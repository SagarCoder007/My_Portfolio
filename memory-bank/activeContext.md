# Active Context: Portfolio Website Development

## Current Work Focus

### Project Phase: Planning & Setup
We're in the initial planning phase, having analyzed the comprehensive portfolio requirements from the user's notes file. The project is structured as a premium developer portfolio using modern web technologies.

### Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with complete project documentation
- Analyzed user's detailed notes file with 13 key requirements
- Established technical architecture and design patterns
- Documented all core technologies and constraints

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Development Setup)
1. **Create project file structure** as defined in techContext.md
2. **Set up base HTML file** with semantic structure
3. **Initialize CSS architecture** with dark theme variables
4. **Include GSAP and Three.js libraries** via CDN or local files
5. **Create basic JavaScript modules** for different functionalities

### Development Priority Order
1. **Base HTML Structure**: Semantic markup for all sections
2. **CSS Foundation**: Dark theme, responsive grid, typography
3. **Navigation System**: Sticky navbar with smooth scrolling
4. **Hero Section**: Three.js background implementation
5. **GSAP Animations**: Scroll triggers and interaction effects
6. **Content Sections**: About, Skills, Projects, Contact
7. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design and touch interactions
8. **Performance Optimization**: Animation toggles and lazy loading

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Decisions Made
- **Dark Theme**: Primary colors `#0f0f0f` and `#1a1a1a` with neon accents
- **Typography**: Modern developer fonts (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Inter)
- **Animation Strategy**: GSAP for all animations with Three.js for 3D backgrounds
- **Architecture**: Component-based modular JavaScript structure

### Technical Considerations
- **Performance First**: Must maintain 60fps animations and <3s load time
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with reduced motion support
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with graceful degradation
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-friendly with simplified animations

### Content Requirements
- **Hero Section**: Developer name, role, tagline, CTAs, social links
- **Skills Display**: Frontend, Backend, Tools, DevOps categories
- **Project Showcase**: 4-6 projects with GitHub/demo links
- **Contact Form**: Validation with EmailJS integration option

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Modular JavaScript**: Separate files for navigation, animations, Three.js, forms
- **CSS Architecture**: BEM methodology with component-based styling
- **Asset Management**: Optimized images, compressed assets, progressive loading
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branches for different components

### Animation Philosophy
- **Subtle and Professional**: Enhance UX without being distracting
- **Performance Conscious**: Animation toggles for accessibility and performance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Mobile Considerations**: Reduced complexity on smaller screens

### Quality Standards
- **Clean Code**: Well-commented, maintainable, and organized
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Consistent experience across modern browsers
- **Responsive Design**: Excellent experience on all device sizes
- **SEO Optimization**: Proper meta tags, semantic markup, fast loading

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Key Success Factors
- **Visual Impact**: First impression crucial for portfolio success
- **Technical Demonstration**: Code quality shows development skills
- **User Experience**: Smooth interactions reflect attention to detail
- **Professional Presentation**: Balance creativity with professionalism

### Potential Challenges
- **Performance Balance**: Rich animations vs. fast loading times
- **Cross-Device Consistency**: Ensuring great experience on all devices
- **Content Management**: Keeping projects and skills up to date
- **Accessibility**: Making advanced animations accessible to all users

### Implementation Strategy
- **Iterative Development**: Build core functionality first, enhance progressively
- **Component Testing**: Test each section independently before integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regular checks during development
- **User Feedback**: Test with target audience (developers, recruiters) when possible

## Current Environment Status
- **Workspace**: Fresh project with only notes.txt file
- **Memory Bank**: Fully established with all core documentation
- **Development Setup**: Ready to begin file structure creation
- **Dependencies**: Need to include GSAP and Three.js libraries
